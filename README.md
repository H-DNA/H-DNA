I am working at Holistics. I mostly feel more inclined to the research aspect at work, but I hate chasing academic achievements, so I think Holistics is a comfortable place.

I want to know more about these areas of computer science:

- Type & language theory (Current focus)
- Logic & Formal system
- Category theory
- Concurrency theory
- Operating systems
- Databases
- Performance
- Engineering in general

Wish I could connect with anyone who shares similar interests or just wants to exchange ideas. I feel like there are a lot to learn.

Some related repositories:

- [type-theory](https://github.com/H-DNA/type-theory): Documenting my research of type & language theory.
- [MPiSC](https://github.com/H-DNA/MPiSC): My bachelor thesis on distributed wait-free MPSC queues, which was my first dive into concurrency theory. This thesis granted me 2 modest publications (although I did not really care about academic publications). I was intrigued by the concept of progress guarantee and the many problems in this field. However, I find it pretty hard.
