I want to know more about these areas of computer science:
* Type & language theory
* Concurrency theory
* Operating systems
* Databases
* Performance
* Engineering in general

Wish I could connect with anyone who shares similar interests or just wants to exchange ideas. I feel like there are a lot to learn.

Some related repositories:
- [type-theory](https://github.com/H-DNA/type-theory): Documenting my research of type & language theory
- [MPiSC](https://github.com/H-DNA/MPiSC): My bachelor thesis on distributed wait-free MPSC queues, which was my first dive into concurrency theory. This thesis granted me 2 modest publications (but I did not really care about academic publications). I was intrigued by the concept of progress guarantee and the many problems in this field. However, I find it pretty hard.
